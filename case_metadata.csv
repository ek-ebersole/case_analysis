STATE OF MARYLAND,MD,2017,Opinion,Criminal,Circuit Court for Howard County,Sizer,State of Maryland,Greene,"In the case before us, we are asked to consider the constitutionality of the stop and the subsequent search incident to the arrest of Petitioner, Jamal Sizer. On the evening of November 20, 2015, five or six officers of the Howard County Police Department Pathways Patrol Unit, a bicycle patrol unit, observed Mr. Sizer and others congregating in a public parking lot, drinking from what appeared to be an open alcohol container. The officers described the group as “loud and disorderly.” The officers observed a bottle being thrown and heard it hit the ground, but could not see who threw the bottle. The officers approached the group to investigate who in the group threw the bottle. Mr. Sizer fled upon the officers’ approach. A chase ensued and ended with the seizure of Mr. Sizer, which led to the discovery that he possessed a .38 caliber revolver in his backpack. Contemporaneously with the seizure of Mr. Sizer, an officer recognized Mr. Sizer as having an outstanding arrest warrant. Subsequently, pursuant to the discovery of the outstanding warrant, Mr. Sizer was arrested and taken to the local police precinct, where an officer searched Mr. Sizer incident to his arrest and recovered a baggie containing twenty-seven pills of oxycodone, a controlled dangerous substance, hidden in his sock.",Affirm,Y

Although the underlying facts of this case involve alleged medical malpractice, it is before us because of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City’s grant of the Defendants’ motion to transfer the case to Talbot County. The Court of Special Appeals reversed the hearing judge’s grant of the motion to transfer, holding that the moving party failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that the convenience of the parties and the interests of justice supported transfer of the case from Baltimore City to Talbot County.

Vol.), Correctional Services Article.1 In particular, we must evaluate the interplay between §§ 10-910(b)(1) and 10-910(b)(6). Section 10-910(b)(1) provides that “[w]ithin 30 days after receipt of” the hearing board’s recommended penalty, “the appointing authority shall . . . issue a final order.” Section 10-910(b)(6) states that “the appointing authority may increase the recommended penalty” if, among other things, the appointing authority “meets with the [charged] correctional officer and allows” the officer “to be heard on the record.” The ultimate question posed here is whether § 10-910(b)(1) precludes remanding a case to the appointing authority to cure a procedural defect that occurred at the penalty- increase meeting. Specifically, we must decide whether the appointing authority should have the opportunity to hold another penalty-increase meeting after the thirty-day deadline for issuing a final order when, as happened here, recording equipment malfunctioned during the initial meeting, preventing the substance of that meeting from being captured “on the record.” A three-member panel of the Court of Special Appeals, in a split decision, held that the appointing authority’s failure to satisfy the “on the record” requirement is incurable after the thirty-day deadline.

Applying Virginia law, the Circuit Court held that a pay-if-paid provision in the subcontract applied to the damages sought in the action, determined that there was no dispute that the owner of the project had not paid the general contractor with respect to the matters in issue, and awarded summary judgment in favor of the general contractor.

The trial court found that it was not in the interest of justice to grant a new trial. Thereafter, Mr. Williams noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed his conviction. The Court of Special Appeals held that “the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the interest of justice did not require granting appellant a new trial.” Before us, Mr. Williams seeks a reversal of that judgment on the grounds that the erroneous jury instruction was prejudicial error and warranted a new trial.",Reversed,Y

The parties negotiated a Master Loan Modification and Forbearance Agreement (“Workout Agreement”) that provided Sweely with another opportunity to pay its debt. When Sweely failed to do so, SunTrust took action against Sweely’s collateral.
In response, Sweely filed this suit against SunTrust, alleging, among other things, breach of contract, fraud in the inducement, and constructive fraud. The circuit court dismissed the case on demurrer, finding that the Workout Agreement defeated Sweely’s breach of contract claim and that Sweely had failed to state a claim for any fraud.

Relying primarily upon its interpretation of the provisions of Code § 8.01-271.1 and its review of the undisputed procedural facts of this case, the Court of Appeals held that McGinnis’ assignment of error was not preserved for appeal in the circuit court under the requirements of Rule 5A:18.

Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 374, 369 (2010), the Supreme Court held for the first time that, pursuant to the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, “counsel must inform [his or] her client whether his [or her] plea carries a risk of deportation[,]” and hat, “when the deportation consequence is truly clear, . . . the duty to give correct advice is equally clear.” After Padilla, in Denisyuk v. State, 422 Md. 462, 466, 30 A.3d 914, 916 (2011), this Court held, in relevant part, that “defense counsel’s failure to advise [the defendant] of the deportation consequence of his guilty plea was constitutionally deficient[,]” and that, “based on the record developed at the postconviction hearing and the [postconviction] court’s express finding on the subject, [] counsel’s deficient performance prejudiced [the defendant].” Additionally, in the wake of Padilla, courts in other jurisdictions have held that a defendant’s counsel’s performance was constitutionally deficient where the defendant’s counsel either failed to advise the defendant whatsoever of the immigration consequences of the defendant’s guilty plea, or affirmatively misadvised the defendant about the immigration consequences of the defendant’s guilty plea. Murkier, however, are
the waters where a defendant’s counsel advises that an offense is deportable and uses “qualifying” words—such as “very likely be deported,” Chacon v. State, 409 S.W.3d 529, 532 (Mo. Ct. App. 2013) (emphasis omitted), or “strong chance” of being deported, State v.

The State charged six Baltimore City police officers with crimes in connection with the events leading up to Mr. Gray’s death—Officer
William Porter, Officer Caesar Goodson, Sergeant Alicia White, Lieutenant Brian Rice, Officer Edward Nero, and Officer Garrett Miller. The first of those officers to face trial was Officer Porter. His trial began on November 30, 2015, and, after the jurors could not reach a verdict, it ended in a mistrial on December 16, 2015. At the heart of this appeal is whether Officer Porter, who the State has indicated it will retry, can now be compelled by the State, before his retrial, to provide immunized testimony against the remaining officers. In the cases of Officer Goodson and Sergeant White, the trial court granted the State’s motion to compel Officer Porter’s testimony. In the cases of Lieutenant Rice, Officer Nero, and Officer Miller, the trial court denied that same motion.","Affirmed in part, reversed in part",N

Under LE § 9-632, an award of benefits by the Workers’ Compensation Commission survives upon the death of an injured employee. On the other hand, under LE § 9-640, an award of benefits survives upon the death of an injured employee only up to $45,000.00.
